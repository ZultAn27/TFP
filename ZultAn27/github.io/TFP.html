            <p class="card-text">Ser Isaac Newton[16] (english. Sir Isaac Newton (sir Isaac Newton) (4 January 1643,
              Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, English kingdom — 31 March 1727, London, Greater London, England, Kingdom of
              Great Britain) — english scientist, which laid the foundations of the modern natural sciences.<span

              <span class="hidden more-info">In the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal
                gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint for centuries until it was superseded by the
                theory of relativity. He used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler's laws of
                planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and
                other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System's heliocentricity.[9] Newton solved the
                two-body problem and introduced the three-body problem. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on
                Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles.</span>

              <span class="hidden more-info">According to Christian tradition, as preserved in the Gospels and the Acts
                of the Apostles, Jesus was circumcised at eight days old, was baptized by John the Baptist as a young
                adult, and after 40 days and nights of fasting in the wilderness, began his own ministry. He was an
                itinerant teacher who interpreted the law of God with divine authority and was often referred to as
                "rabbi". Jesus often debated with his fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught
                in parables, and gathered followers, among whom 12 were appointed as his apostles</span>

                training of the mind that includes ethical training and kindness toward others, and meditative practices
